# SuperAPRaspPiProject
This project aims to implement an AI animal recognition system into a Raspberry Pi-4. I hope to be able to access the stream from my phone and document the different animals that are captured by the camera. I also must figure out how to waterproof it and mount it. 

## About
Context:
-Nature-oriented
-using technology to help progress scientific research
-I am applying to a data collection internship trip to the Santa Cruz islands this summer with UCSB. I hope this will be a good addition to my resume
## Goals and requirements 
-Learn how to use a Rasp. Pi. 
-Learn whatever languages I need to implement software onto the system
-Create a functional camera vision system
-Collect Data on the wildlife in my neighborhood
Essential Questions:
-Where to put the cam
-How to install it
-What components to order
-What OS to use
-What image processing library to use
-How to display it on my phone
-How to store the recognition instances *very hard to do :o

### Sprint Goal

-March 27-figure out how to acess rasp-pi feed from my phone! (still having a lot of probelms)
-March 28-30- at robotics comp so i cannot do anything :o 
-March 31-fully mount and install rasp-pi to tree (also it doesn't have night vision, and animals only come out at night usually, so i may have to tie a flashlight to a tree perhaps)
-April 1st-figure out how to store the video files
-April 2nd-continue task from April 1st
-April 3rd- work on presentation and all that jazz, scan journal pages, ect
-April 4th- finishe instructions and README file
-April 5th- due
